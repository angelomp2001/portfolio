                <strong>Megaline - Revenue Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal and Challenges: Determine which of the prepaid phone plans brings in more
                        revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. The data was highly fragmented and a sampling
                        was required due to the large data size.</li>
                    <li>Methods: Hypothesis testing was used to determine differences between plans and
                        customer characteristics. Data management techniques related to data joining and grouping.
                        Aggregation functions were used to analyze revenue by both year and month.</li>
                    <li>Results: 66% of users were on Surf (the cheaper plan). General usage behavior
                        between plans (number of calls, call duration, number of messages, number of internet sessions,
                        and overall data usage) across years and months were not statistically different.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Instacart - Customer Behavior Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Goal and Challenges: Understand customer behavior. Conclusions could contribute to driving
                        operational efficiency, marketing, and revenue forecasting decisions. To achieve the goal,
                        dataframes needed to be linked appropriately in order to conduct proper analysis. Some
                        columns had incorrect data types (e.g., order IDs as floats instead of integers) and certain
                        columns had missing values that needed to be handled appropriately, like subscription end
                        date. </li>
                    <li>Methods: Handled nonstandard formatting, verified and corrected values and data
                        types, identified missing values and filled them using appropriate strategies (e.g., drop, mean,
                        max, min, etc.). Removed duplicates. Created histograms, box plots, and bar plots to visualize
                        the data. Used group and aggregation functions to explore additional data distributions.</li>
                    <li>Results: Shoppers tended to buy between 10am - 4pm at the beginning of the
                        week. About half of shoppers submitted orders once every 2 weeks, and the other half once every
                        month or longer, on average. The average customer ordered 3-10 products per order and placed
                        between 1 and 5 orders during the dataset time frame. The most common items purchased were a
                        wide variety of produce (bananas, avocados, etc.) and milk. Reorders (48% of all orders) were
                        typically of the same perishable produce and milk.</li>
