               <strong>OilyGiant - Investment Risk of Loss Mimization</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal and Challenges: Identify the most profitable region for new oil well development by analyzing oil quality and reserve volumes across three regions. The challenge was to build predictive models for each region, calculate potential profits, and assess risks using bootstrapping to make an economically sound decision.  </li>
                    <li>Methods: Linear regression models were trained on data from three regions to predict oil reserve volumes. Bootstrapping with 1000 samples was used to estimate profit distributions and risk of losses. The top 200 wells from 500 exploration points were selected for development based on predicted reserves.</li>
                    <li>Results: One region emerged as the optimal choice and the lowest risk of loss. While another region showed higher mean profit, it had a higher risk of loss. The analysis balanced potential returns against business constraints including the development budget and the requirement to keep risk below a specific threshold.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

               <strong>Beta Bank - Customer Attrition Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal and Challenges: Determine which customers are most likely to exit next, so the client can focus on keeping them. Attrition was extremely low, so predicting who was next was hard.  </li>
                    <li>Methods: Data sampling methods (upscaling, downscaling, class weight balancing) and parameter optimization were applied to three models and compared to predict attrition. </li>
                    <li>Results: Downsampling was the most effective sampling method for improving model score.  Random Forest was the most accurate model by all metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <strong>Megaline - Revenue Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal and Challenges: Determine which of the prepaid phone plans brings in more
                        revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. The data was highly fragmented and a sampling
                        was required due to the large data size.</li>
                    <li>Methods: Hypothesis testing was used to determine differences between plans and
                        customer characteristics. Data management techniques related to data joining and grouping.
                        Aggregation functions were used to analyze revenue by both year and month.</li>
                    <li>Results: 66% of users were on Surf (the cheaper plan). General usage behavior
                        between plans (number of calls, call duration, number of messages, number of internet sessions,
                        and overall data usage) across years and months were not statistically different.</li>

                <strong>Instacart - Customer Behavior Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Goal and Challenges: Understand customer behavior. Conclusions could contribute to driving
                        operational efficiency, marketing, and revenue forecasting decisions. To achieve the goal,
                        dataframes needed to be linked appropriately in order to conduct proper analysis. Some
                        columns had incorrect data types (e.g., order IDs as floats instead of integers) and certain
                        columns had missing values that needed to be handled appropriately, like subscription end
                        date. </li>
                    <li>Methods: Handled nonstandard formatting, verified and corrected values and data
                        types, identified missing values and filled them using appropriate strategies (e.g., drop, mean,
                        max, min, etc.). Removed duplicates. Created histograms, box plots, and bar plots to visualize
                        the data. Used group and aggregation functions to explore additional data distributions.</li>
                    <li>Results: Shoppers tended to buy between 10am - 4pm at the beginning of the
                        week. About half of shoppers submitted orders once every 2 weeks, and the other half once every
                        month or longer, on average. The average customer ordered 3-10 products per order and placed
                        between 1 and 5 orders during the dataset time frame. The most common items purchased were a
                        wide variety of produce (bananas, avocados, etc.) and milk. Reorders (48% of all orders) were
                        typically of the same perishable produce and milk.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>
                <strong>Megaline - Plan Recommendation Model</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal and Challenges: Develop a model to recommend one of Megaline’s newer plans (Smart or Ultra)
                        based on
                        subscriber behavior. Achieve an accuracy threshold of at least 75%. Account for imbalanced data
                        in model fitting and model evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Methods: Used behavior data from subscribers who had already switched to new plans. Training
                        data, accounting for imbalance, was used to train the model. The model was evaluated against a
                        naive baseline (dummy classifier) that predicted according to the target’s proportions,
                        establishing a meaningful benchmark.</li>
                    <li>Results: The final model achieved 81% accuracy on the test set, outperforming the baseline model
                        (69%) by 12%. This exceeded the required 5% outperformance threshold by over 2x, demonstrating
                        the model’s value.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Ice - Sales Analysis</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal and Challenges: Identify patterns that determine whether a video game succeeds, using user
                        and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales data. Use insights to spot potential
                        big winners and plan advertising campaigns for 2017. Challenges included working with incomplete
                        data (missing price and units sold) and accounting for differences across platforms, genres, and
                        regions.</li>
                    <li>Methods: Analyzed data from open sources covering game releases, sales, reviews, genres, and
                        platforms up to December 2016. Explored trends in game releases, sales peaks, platform life
                        cycles, and regional performance. Examined correlations between critic/user scores and sales,
                        and compared sales distributions across platforms and genres. Investigated regional differences
                        in sales, genre popularity, and ratings.</li>
                    <li>Results: Peak game releases and sales occurred in 2008; peak mean sales per game was in 1989.
                        New platforms drive new sales, but all platforms decline over time, with a typical sales cycle
                        of about 10 years. Top platforms by sales: PS3, X360, Wii. Year-over-year growth is strongest in
                        the first year of a platform and declines thereafter. Sales distributions by platform are not
                        always normal. Critic and user scores are correlated, and higher ratings are associated with
                        higher sales. Action is the top-selling genre, but sales across all genres are declining. North
                        America and Europe are the largest markets and perform similarly; Japan and other regions have
                        lower but similar sales. Genre sales and ratings vary by region. Average user ratings differ
                        between Xbox and PC, but not between Action and Sports genres. Analysis could be improved with
                        access to price and units sold data.</li>
